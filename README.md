### What is Surviving Halloween?
It is a browser game in which the player has to avoid monsters to stay alive, reach a score of 100 and survive halloween. 

### Ironhack Project
Surviving Halloween is the very first project made by [Ashley Vermaas](https://github.com/ashleyvermaas) during the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Canvas, and has been deployed via GitHub Pages.

### Instructions
The game can be played on a laptop or computer, it is currently not possible to play on a mobile device. Use the arrow keys to steer clear of the monsters. As time passes, the difficulty will increase; the monsters will approach faster and more often. Are you able survive long enough to pass all the levels?

### Status
This project is a work in progress and needs several improvements and bug fixes. It's far from perfect, but it is made with love and is still pretty amazing for a first project.
