### What is Surviving Halloween?
It is a browser game in which the player has to avoid monsters to stay alive, reach a score of 100 and survive halloween. 

### Ironhack Project #1
Surviving Halloween is the very first project made by [Ashley Vermaas](https://github.com/ashleyvermaas) during the first module of the [Ironhack](https://ironhack.com/en) Web Development Bootcamp. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Canvas, and has been deployed via GitHub Pages. The main focus was using recently learned technologies and skills for front-end web development.

### Instructions
The game can be played on a laptop or computer, it is currently not possible to play on a mobile device. Use the arrow keys to steer clear of the monsters. As time passes, the difficulty will increase; the monsters will approach faster and more often. Are you able survive long enough to pass all the levels?

### Status
This project is a work in progress and needs several improvements and bug fixes. It's far from perfect, but it is made with love and is still pretty amazing for a first project.

### Credits

Happy Halloween (if you survive) ðŸŽƒ
